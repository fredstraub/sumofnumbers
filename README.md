# sumofnumbers

This is exercie E26, Five problems every software engineer should be able to solve (Part 1).

The first attempt: sumofnumbers1.js and index1.html took 30:03 to complete.  The underscore function was not working as expected.

The second attempt: sumofnumbers2.js and index2.html took 34:49 to complete.  I initially implemented and infinite loop in the while function. I figured out the underscore function was not working as I expected because the .pop I was using in the recursion function was changing the array.
