# sumofnumbers

This is exercie E26, Five problems every software engineer should be able to solve (Part 1).

Write four functions that return the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, a while-loop, recursion, and underscore. Call them sumFor, sumWhile, sumRecursion, and sumTheSimpleWay.

The first attempt: sumofnumbers1.js and index1.html took 30:03 to complete.  The underscore function was not working as expected.

The second attempt: sumofnumbers2.js and index2.html took 34:49 to complete.  I initially implemented and infinite loop in the while function. I figured out the underscore function was not working as I expected because the .pop I was using in the recursion function was changing the array.

The third attempt: sumofnumbers.js and index.html took 14:05 to complete.
